# nitrobot-sim
A mobile robot simulation to get started with working in ROS2

Building this as a side project to refurbish my skills in ROS2 with mobile robots. This robot is a Differential Drive robot, consisting of sensors like LIDAR, monocular camera and a depth camera.
The goal is to build:

A robot using URDF files in xml language
Create a simulation world in gazebo
Implement ROS2 control using the DiffDrive
Configure and accurately set up the sensors for environment perception
Localize the robot in the environment using the slam_toolbox
Perform autonomous navigation using the Nav2 stack
Additional tasks to learn other features
